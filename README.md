# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



#About React router Task

This project is a React application that utilizes react-router-dom to create a dynamic and responsive navigation menu, emulating the course categories found on the GUVI blog page. The application includes a NavigationMenu component with links to various course categories such as "All", "Full Stack Development", "Data Science", "Cyber Security", and "Career". Each category has a dedicated component that displays static content, allowing users to navigate seamlessly between different sections of the application. Additionally, a NavigateButton component demonstrates programmatic navigation to the Data Science section using the useNavigate hook from react-router-dom.

To enhance the user experience, the project also includes a footer component that appears at the bottom of every page. The footer provides links to social media and other relevant information. The application's design features a two-color gradient background for the navigation header, ensuring a modern and visually appealing interface. This project demonstrates the effective use of React and react-router-dom to build a structured, multi-page application with smooth navigation and consistent styling.
